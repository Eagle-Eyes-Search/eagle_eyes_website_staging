    <h3 class="pb-40" style="text-align: center">System limitations</h3>
    <p>Eagle Eyes is a powerful tool designed to assist Search and Rescue operations, but it has inherent limitations. The system may produce false positives (e.g., brightly colored debris) and false negatives (e.g., camouflaged objects). For optimal performance, it requires high-quality and stable footage, as blurry or fast-moving video can reduce accuracy. Additionally, high-speed or high-altitude flights may impact detection effectiveness. Users should always verify detections manually and treat the system as a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for human judgment.</p>
