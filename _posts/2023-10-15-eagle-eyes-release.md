We're excited to announce the official release of Eagle Eyes, our advanced computer vision platform designed specifically for search and rescue operations.

## What is Eagle Eyes?

Eagle Eyes is a cutting-edge software solution that helps search and rescue teams locate missing persons more efficiently. By leveraging the latest advances in computer vision and machine learning, Eagle Eyes can detect objects and people in drone footage that might otherwise be missed by human operators.

Our platform consists of two main components:

### Eagle Eyes Pilot

A mobile application that provides real-time detection while flying your drone. Eagle Eyes Pilot integrates with your drone's controller to display the live video feed with automatic detection boxes around potential subjects.

### Eagle Eyes Scan

A desktop application for analyzing pre-recorded drone footage. With Eagle Eyes Scan, you can process videos after your flight to ensure nothing was missed during the initial search.

## Features

- **Real-time detection** - Get immediate alerts when potential subjects are detected in your drone's field of view
- **Motion detection** - Identify moving subjects even when they blend into the background
- **Color anomaly detection** - Find objects with colors that stand out from the natural environment
- **Thermal integration** - Compatible with thermal imaging for night operations and difficult terrain
- **Offline operation** - Works without an internet connection in remote areas
- **Cross-platform** - Available for Windows, Mac, and Android devices

## Why We Built Eagle Eyes

Search and rescue operations often involve scanning vast areas of wilderness where missing persons appear as tiny specks in large landscapes. Human operators can easily miss critical details, especially after hours of searching when fatigue sets in.

We developed Eagle Eyes to serve as a "second set of eyes" that never tires, helping SAR teams maintain their effectiveness throughout extended operations.
