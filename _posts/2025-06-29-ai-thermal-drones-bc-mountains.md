The wind howls through the jagged peaks of Vancouver's Coast Mountains, where the forest is a labyrinth of towering cedars and shadowed gullies. It's the kind of place where one wrong step can turn a hike into a fight for survival.

Beneath a steel-gray sky, a hiker shivers under a gnarled cedar gripping the rocks on the edge of a rushing river. His breath is shallow, his body going numb. Hours earlier, he veered off trail. Now the wilderness has swallowed him whole. Time is running out.

High above, a faint hum cuts through the wind. It's not a bird or a plane. It's a drone. Its cameras slice through the dusk, guided by something far sharper than human eyes alone.

In April, CBC News ran a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/technology-drone-artificial-intelligence-search-rescue-british-columbia-mountains-1.7492363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature</a> spotlighting <a href="https://www.northshorerescue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Shore Rescue</a>, one of Canada's most experienced volunteer SAR teams working to save lives in BC's unforgiving backcountry. Equipped with multi-sensor drones and powered by computer vision, they're reshaping what's possible in search and rescue.

It's a biting winter evening. North Shore Rescue's drone team lead, Grant Baldwin, is running out of daylight and batteries. His team's mission is to find the missing hiker before hypothermia sets in.

The terrain is brutal. Cliffs, thick underbrush, creeks. No human could search it all fast enough. But the drone can.

With a whir, it lifts off. Its thermal camera scans the landscape in shades of heat, looking for the unusual. A patch of warmth. A splash of color that doesn't belong. A flicker of movement. When it finds something, with the help of Eagle Eyes software, it beams that data straight into the team's <a href="https://caltopo.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CalTopo map</a>.

"It's about speed," Baldwin told CBC. "Getting that info to the map fast so we can act."

That night, the drone locks onto a thermal signature. Just enough heat to spot the hiker beneath a tree by the river. The team moves in. They find him cold, soaked, but alive.

Without that drone, it could've been a body recovery.

Drones equipped with thermal cameras and Eagle Eyes computer vision are helping search teams scan terrain too dangerous or vast for humans alone. They're spotting the needle in the haystack and helping teams get to it in time.
