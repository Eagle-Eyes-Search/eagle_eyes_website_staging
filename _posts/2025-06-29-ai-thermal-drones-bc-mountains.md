In the rugged terrain of Vancouver’s Coast Mountains, where dense forests and steep ravines lurk with unexpected hazards just beyond the city’s edge, a single misstep can transform a routine hike into a life-threatening ordeal. Picture a hiker, disoriented beneath a shrouded, cloudy sky battered by rain, snow, and howling winds, seeking refuge under a gnarled cedar tree beside a roaring, fast-flowing river. Hypothermia creeps closer as temperatures plummet and visibility dwindles to a haze. When conditions turn dire, every second counts.


In April,<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/technology-drone-artificial-intelligence-search-rescue-british-columbia-mountains-1.7492363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC News highlghted</a> the efforts of <a href="https://www.northshorerescue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Shore Rescue</a>, one of Canada's busiest volunteer SAR teams working to save lives in BC's unforgiving backcountry. Their integration of drones with thermal cameras and computer vision is changing SAR in the province's challenging backcountry.

On a cold winter evening, Grant Baldwin, North Shore Rescue’s drone team leader, described a mission where his team faced fading daylight and limited drone battery life while searching for a missing hiker. The search area had treacherous cliffs, and dense vegetation, and waterways, making it extrmeley hazardous and hard to access for human searchers.

Deploying the drone proved pivotal. Its thermal camera surveyed the hard to access terrain, identifying a faint heat signature amid the cold surroundings. As Baldwin explained to CBC, "It's about speed, getting that information to the map quickly so we can respond effectively." That evening, the drone pinpointed a faint thermal signature: the hiker, huddled under a tree near the river. The ground team was dispatched promptly, locating the individual, cold and wet, but alive.

Without this technology, the outcome might have been tragic, shifting from rescue to recovery.

Drones equipped with thermal cameras and computer vision tools like Eagle Eyes help enable SAR teams to cover hazardous or expansive areas efficiently. They enhance the ability to locate individuals in distress, potentially making the difference between life and death. Using Eagle Eyes software, these drones can now relay real-time GPS data and drone imagery from the drone directly to the team's CalTopo map.
