In April, CBC News ran a feature on how North Shore Rescue (NSR) is using drones equipped with thermal cameras and artificial intelligence to locate missing hikers in Vancouver's rugged Coast Mountains. The piece highlights the growing role of Canadian-made technology — including our own Eagle Eyes software — in search and rescue.

Grant Baldwin, NSR's drone team lead, described how drones let rescuers quickly scan otherwise inaccessible gullies, cliffs, and creeks. In one December mission, his team located a hypothermic hiker huddled under a tree — saving what could have become a fatal night.

## How AI Enhances Search Operations

The article also explores how AI tools, like Eagle Eyes, detect anomalies in landscapes that human pilots might miss. Even when a person is just a few pixels or obscured in dense forest, the software flags unusual colors or movements and gets that information into the team's map in real time.

As Baldwin told CBC, "It helps get that information into the map as quick as possible so they can act on it."

## Technology Saving Lives

This collaboration between human expertise and AI technology represents a significant advancement in search and rescue capabilities. The combination of thermal imaging and intelligent detection systems allows teams to cover vast areas of challenging terrain more effectively than ever before.
