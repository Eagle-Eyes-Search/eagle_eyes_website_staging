Last week, <a href="https://www.wired.it/article/escursionista-disperso-monviso-cadavere-drone-intelligenza-artificiale-soccorso-alpino/" target="_blank"><img src="{{ '/images/blog/wired-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Wired Magazine" style="height: 20px; vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 3px;"></a> and <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/italy-climber-ai/" target="_blank"><img src="{{ '/images/blog/outside-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Outside Magazine" style="height: 20px; vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 3px;"></a> magazines reported on a recovery operation led by the Piedmont Alpine Rescue team, part of the <a href="https://www.cnsas.it/en/" target="_blank">Italian Mountain Rescue Corps (CNSAS)</a>, on Monviso, the highest peak in the Cottian Alps. Nearly a year after a 64-year-old mountaineer went missing, CNSAS drone pilots Saverio Isola and Giorgio Viana and their team located his remains using AI analysis of thousands of drone images.

During the search, the team used both Eagle Eyes and ADIAT by TexSAR. As the CNSAS pilots later told the Eagle Eyes team, Eagle Eyes was crucial in rapidly analysing thousands of drone images in just a few hours, detecting a subtle color anomaly that turned out to be the mountaineer's helmet; ADIAT was then used to verify the finding, confirming the result and ensuring accuracy. At Eagle Eyes, we are honoured that our technology was part of this mission and proud to have helped provide closure to the family of the missing mountaineer in this tragic situation, and we also commend ADIAT for their vital roleâ€”working together with them demonstrates the strength of combining tools to support search and rescue teams in the field.

## Location of Monviso in the Italian Alps

The mission took place on the mountain's rugged north face, in a steep couloir above a hanging glacier. Monviso, also known as Monte Viso, is the highest peak in the Cottian Alps and a striking landmark sometimes mentioned as a possible inspiration for the Paramount Pictures logo. Search teams had previously been unable to locate any sign of the missing man. After launching two drones to capture 2,600 images across a 183-hectare area, the CNSAS drone team processed the imagery with Eagle Eyes, which flagged a small cluster of red pixels, what Wired Italia described as "colored pixels from the mountaineer's helmet hidden among rocks." ADIAT was then used to validate the finding.

## Example of an Eagle Eyes Color Detection

Weather delayed the response the next day, but early the following morning the team flew back to the site and visually confirmed the helmet with a drone flyover, guided by the exact GPS coordinates from the Eagle Eyes detection that pinpointed where the red pixels had been flagged. The body was later recovered with assistance from emergency services.

## AI-Powered, Computer Vision Drone Search: From Weeks to Hours

In traditional ground or manual photo review efforts, such a search could have taken weeks. This combined approach, Eagle Eyes for rapid detection and ADIAT for verification, narrowed it down to hours. As pilot Isola told Wired Italia, "It's a human achievement, but without technology, it would have been an impossible mission."

Piedmont's Alpine Rescue team has been developing and refining AI-based drone search and rescue methods for over a year, combining thermal sensors, high-resolution cameras, and object detection algorithms. Using tools like Eagle Eyes and ADIAT enables rescuers to detect subtle visual clues across vast, complex terrain and, in this case, bring closure to a long and difficult search.
