        Eagle Eyes is a computer vision and geolocation system, designed to help drone operators spot things that they may normally miss in search and rescue operations.  It consists of an Android App and a Video Scanner.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Android App is shown in the above video.  It is used to pilot DJI drones, scan the live video stream for anomalies, bring them to the attention of the operator, and record their coordinates on the map.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Video Scanner scans through pre-recorded video on your computer and presents the operator with a set of detections and their positions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        See <a href='/demo_page.html'>the full set of demos</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        The system is under development.  As of January 2023, we are preparing the first prototype for deployment.
